🌍 **CI/CD Workflow**

**🏗 Build, Test, Deploy Pipeline**

1.  Push Code to GitHub → Triggers GitHub Actions
2.  Lint & Test Code → Runs ESLint & Jest for quality assurance
3.  Build Docker Image → Packages the application into a container
4.  Push to AWS ECR → Stores image in AWS Elastic Container Registry
5.  Deploy to AWS ECS → Updates running container with new image
6.  Monitor with AWS CloudWatch → Ensures uptime & security
